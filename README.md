### What I learned

Throughout the development of this portfolio, I enhanced my skills in various areas:

- Responsive Design: Implemented a mobile-first workflow to ensure the portfolio looks great on all devices.
- React Components: Developed reusable and maintainable components for different sections of the portfolio.
- Styled Components: Utilized styled-components for better CSS management and scoped styling.
- React Router: Implemented React Router for smooth navigation between different sections of the portfolio.

```js
// Example project data structure
const projects = [
    {
        id: 1,
        title: "Project One",
        description: "This is a brief description of Project One.",
        imageUrl: "path/to/image.jpg",
        projectUrl: "https://github.com/username/project-one"
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        title: "Project Two",
        description: "This is a brief description of Project Two.",
        imageUrl: "path/to/image.jpg",
        projectUrl: "https://github.com/username/project-two"
    },
];

// Passing data to Project component
<ProjectList projects={projects} />

```

### Continued development
In future iterations of this project, I plan to:

- Expand Portfolio Content: Add more projects and detailed descriptions to enhance the portfolio.
- Improve Accessibility: Ensure the website is fully accessible to users with disabilities.
- Add Animations: Integrate subtle animations to enhance user engagement and interactivity.
- Backend Integration: Implement a backend to manage contact form submissions and other dynamic content.
